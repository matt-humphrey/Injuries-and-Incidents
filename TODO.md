# TODO

## General

*Use TDD framework*
Develop a single module/class from which to reference in all notebooks.
Set up a data pipeline.
Define Schemas to validate data and/or coerce variables into expected format (based on base name?)

- [x] Read spreadsheet data into notebook
- [x] Create a dictionary mapping datasets with relevant variables
- [x] Read SPSS data into notebook and filter for relevant variables
- [ ] Convert notebook into nbdev notebook (incorporate version control and documentation)
- [ ] Refactor G201 notebook and convert into template


- [ ] Select a base variable to explore, define corresponding datasets, and investigate that variable
- [ ] Define a Schema to validate the variable for both data (type, range of values) and metadata (type, var label, val label)

## Harmonise G201 

- Change values of 0 to -1 (when 0 means 'related to previous injury')
